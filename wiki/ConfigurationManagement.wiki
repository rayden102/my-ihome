#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Programming Environment =
As programming environment Atmel Studio was chosen due to its integration and comprehensive solution. Out of the box user receives IDE, cross-compiler (avr-gcc), device programming tooling, simulator, debugger and more. Functionality may also be enhanced with Atmel Gallery (plug-in like extension platform).

== Atmel Software Framework ==
The ASF is a MCU software library providing a large collection of embedded software for MCUs. Normally integrated with AtmelStudio, however latest version can be found here [http://www.atmel.com/tools/AVRSOFTWAREFRAMEWORK.aspx ASF].

Other approach is to use Linux environment and Eclipse as IDE.

== Atmel Studio ==
Latest version available on Atmel's site [http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELSTUDIO.aspx AtmelStudio].

= Microcontroller =
To satisfy project needs AVR XMEGA uC was chosen as a primary device to run real-time applications.
XMEGA family detailed description can be found [http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/avr/avr_xmega.aspx?tab=documents here].

== D Series ==
System blocks are targetted on D4 series MCU and ATxmega32D4 specifically.
More information can be found here: [http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATXMEGA32D4.aspx 32D4].

D4 offers enough processing power and internal interfaces and peripherals to run applications with specific tasks.

== In-System Programmer (ISP) ==
XMEGA uC use PDI as programming interface. Two solutions has been tested and working fine under Atmel Studio 6. First is Atmel's AVR JTAGICE mkII [http://www.atmel.com/tools/AVRJTAGICEMKII.aspx here]. The latter is a clone of original device supplied by 3rd party companies.
USB AVR PROG MKII was tested and is working fine with XMEGAs A and D series. In addition this programmer provides power supply to programmed device eliminating need for use external supply. Description can be found here [http://www.sibit.pl/sklep/?25,usb-avr-prog-mkii clone].
